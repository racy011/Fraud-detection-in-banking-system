# Fraud-detection-in-banking-system
This code performs an in-depth analysis of a fraud detection dataset, focusing on identifying fraudulent transactions. It covers data exploration, feature selection, data cleaning, and outlier handling. The main goal is to assess transaction types, calculate fraud percentages, visualize patterns, and clean data for further modeling. It ultimately aids in predicting fraud based on features like transaction type and amount.

Key Points:
- Data Exploration*: Visualizes distribution, correlation, and class imbalance.
- Fraud Analysis*: Breakdown of fraud by transaction type.
- Data Cleaning*: Handles missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Feature Selection*: Uses correlation, variance threshold, and model-based selection.
- Data Splitting*: Prepares data for training/testing.
